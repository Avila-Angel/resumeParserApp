## General info
A resume parsing application that allows recruiters to filter through uploaded resumes using specific keywords they're looking for.


## Technologies
This project is created with:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Firebase


## Functionality
I used HTML and CSS to create the layout of the web application. After creating the layout, I used JavaScript to create the necessary functions allowing users to 
upload their resume to a firebase database, which can then be retreived when a user inputs certain keywords in the textfield and their is a match. <b />

* Input text field - a text field that allows users to input keywords
* Search Button - a functional button that sends a pull request to the database, requesting resumes with certain keywords
* "Resumes:" Container - a container that displays the filtered resumes when the pull request is completed
* Drag & Drop container - a functional container that allows users to drag and drop their resume
* Browse File Button - a button that allows users to attach their resume to the container by opening a window that shows the users local directory 
* Upload Button - a functional button that pushes the data stored within the container (your resume) to the database, where it is stored for later retreival
* Social Icons - functional icons that when clicked on, opens a new tab that allows users to see my person LinkedIn page, Github page, and the opportunity to email me
